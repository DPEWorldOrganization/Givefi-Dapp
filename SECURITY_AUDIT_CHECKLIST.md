# GiveFi Security Audit Checklist

## Critical Security Fixes Applied ✅

### 1. Randomness Security
- **FIXED**: Replaced weak deterministic randomness with Switchboard VRF
- **Added**: Two-step randomness process (request → settle)
- **Added**: Fallback mechanism using recent blockhash with time delay
- **Files**: `lib.rs:153-274`

### 2. Access Control
- **FIXED**: Added owner validation in `ClaimJackpot` struct
- **Added**: Constraint to ensure owner == giveaway.authority
- **Files**: `lib.rs:723-727`

### 3. Safe Token Transfers
- **FIXED**: Replaced direct lamport manipulation with proper CPI calls
- **Added**: Proper PDA signer seeds for SOL transfers
- **Files**: `lib.rs:318-357, 431-444`

## Security Review Areas

### 1. Authentication & Authorization ✅
- [x] Program initialization restricted to authority
- [x] Giveaway creation properly validates creator
- [x] Early end restricted to giveaway authority
- [x] Prize claims validate winner identity
- [x] Owner validation in jackpot claims

### 2. Input Validation ✅
- [x] Entry cost must be > 0
- [x] Max entries must be > 0
- [x] Min participants ≤ max entries
- [x] End timestamp in future
- [x] Prize description length limited

### 3. State Management ✅
- [x] Proper state transitions (active → inactive)
- [x] Winner can only be drawn once
- [x] Prizes can only be claimed once
- [x] Refunds only when giveaway unsuccessful

### 4. Economic Security ✅
- [x] Proper fund distribution (33% winner, 60% owner, 7% treasury)
- [x] Funds locked in PDAs until distribution
- [x] No fund extraction before completion
- [x] Refund mechanism for failed giveaways

### 5. Randomness Security ✅
- [x] Cryptographically secure VRF implementation
- [x] Fallback randomness with time delays
- [x] No predictable winner selection

## Areas Requiring Special Attention

### 1. VRF Integration
- Verify Switchboard VRF account validation
- Test VRF failure scenarios
- Ensure proper handling of VRF timeouts

### 2. PDA Security
- Verify all PDA derivations use correct seeds
- Check bump validation in all structs
- Ensure no PDA collision possibilities

### 3. Token Handling
- Verify proper SPL token CPI calls
- Check token account ownership validation
- Test with various token mint configurations

### 4. Reentrancy Protection
- Review all CPI calls for reentrancy risks
- Verify state updates before external calls
- Check account closing operations

## Test Coverage

### Unit Tests ✅
- Program initialization
- Giveaway creation and validation
- Entry processes (SOL and token)
- Winner selection and prize claiming
- Access control enforcement
- Edge cases and error conditions

### Integration Tests Required
- [ ] Full giveaway lifecycle end-to-end
- [ ] VRF integration testing
- [ ] Multi-participant scenarios
- [ ] Token-based giveaway flows
- [ ] Stress testing with max participants

### Security Tests Required
- [ ] Reentrancy attack attempts
- [ ] PDA collision testing
- [ ] Invalid signer testing
- [ ] Fund extraction attempts
- [ ] State manipulation attempts

## Deployment Checklist

### Pre-Deployment ✅
- [x] All critical security fixes applied
- [x] Comprehensive test suite implemented
- [x] Code review completed
- [x] Documentation updated

### Post-Audit Required
- [ ] Professional security audit completed
- [ ] All audit findings addressed
- [ ] Final test suite run with 100% coverage
- [ ] Bug bounty program consideration

## Known Limitations

1. **VRF Dependency**: Contract relies on Switchboard VRF service availability
2. **Fallback Randomness**: Uses blockhash as fallback (less secure but functional)
3. **Gas Costs**: Multiple accounts required for full functionality
4. **Token Support**: Currently supports single token type per giveaway

## Audit Recommendations

1. **Focus Areas**: Randomness implementation, fund handling, access controls
2. **Test Scenarios**: High-value giveaways, edge cases, attack vectors
3. **Documentation**: Review this checklist and implementation details
4. **Code Review**: Special attention to `lib.rs:153-440` (critical functions)
