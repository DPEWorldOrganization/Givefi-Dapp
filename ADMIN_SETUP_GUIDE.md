# GiveFi Admin Access Control System

## Overview

Your GiveFi platform now has a robust admin access control system that ensures only authorized wallets can create and manage raffles. Here's how it works:

## Security Features

### üîí Wallet-Based Access Control
- Only wallets in the `AUTHORIZED_ADMIN_WALLETS` array can access admin functions
- All admin actions require wallet connection AND authorization verification
- Unauthorized wallets see an "Access Denied" screen

### üõ°Ô∏è Protected Admin Functions
The following functions now require admin authorization:
- `createRaffle()` - Create new raffles
- `selectWinner()` - Select raffle winners
- `endRaffle()` - End raffles early
- `pauseRaffle()` - Pause active raffles
- `withdrawFunds()` - Withdraw accumulated funds
- `viewParticipants()` - View participant lists
- `exportParticipants()` - Export participant data

## Setup Instructions

### Method 1: Automatic Setup (Recommended)
1. Run the setup script:
   ```bash
   ./setup-admin.sh
   ```
2. Enter your Solana wallet address when prompted
3. Confirm the address
4. The script will automatically update both admin files

### Method 2: Manual Setup
1. Open `admin.html` and `deploy/admin.html`
2. Find this line (around line 790):
   ```javascript
   const AUTHORIZED_ADMIN_WALLETS = [
       'YOUR_WALLET_ADDRESS_HERE',
   ];
   ```
3. Replace `'YOUR_WALLET_ADDRESS_HERE'` with your actual Solana wallet address
4. Save both files

### Method 3: Multiple Admins
To add multiple admin wallets, edit the array like this:
```javascript
const AUTHORIZED_ADMIN_WALLETS = [
    'YourMainWalletAddress123...',
    'YourBackupWalletAddress456...',
    'AnotherAdminWalletAddress789...',
];
```

## How It Works

### 1. Connection Process
1. User visits admin panel (`admin.html`)
2. Clicks "Connect Wallet"
3. System checks if connected wallet is in `AUTHORIZED_ADMIN_WALLETS`
4. If authorized: Full admin access granted
5. If unauthorized: "Access Denied" screen shown

### 2. Access Control Flow
```
User connects wallet
       ‚Üì
checkAdminAccess(walletAddress)
       ‚Üì
Is wallet in AUTHORIZED_ADMIN_WALLETS?
       ‚Üì                    ‚Üì
     YES                   NO
       ‚Üì                    ‚Üì
Admin Interface      Access Denied Screen
```

### 3. Runtime Protection
- Every admin function checks `isAuthorizedAdmin` flag
- Functions return early with error if not authorized
- User sees appropriate error messages

## Configuration States

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Unconfigured (Default)
- Red warning banner appears: "SETUP REQUIRED"
- Placeholder address `YOUR_WALLET_ADDRESS_HERE` is present
- Console warning logged

### ‚úÖ Configured
- No warning banner
- Your actual wallet address is in the authorized list
- Full admin functionality available

## Getting Your Wallet Address

### Phantom Wallet
1. Open Phantom wallet
2. Click your wallet name at the top
3. Click "Copy Address"
4. This is your wallet address

### Solflare Wallet
1. Open Solflare wallet
2. Click the copy icon next to your address
3. This is your wallet address

### Other Wallets
- Look for "Copy Address", "Copy Public Key", or similar option
- The address should be 32-44 characters long

## Security Best Practices

### ‚úÖ Do's
- Use a dedicated admin wallet for managing the platform
- Keep your private keys secure and never share them
- Regularly backup your wallet
- Consider using a hardware wallet for admin functions
- Test with small amounts first

### ‚ùå Don'ts
- Never share your wallet's private key or seed phrase
- Don't use the same wallet for high-risk activities
- Don't store large amounts of SOL in your admin wallet
- Don't give admin access to untrusted wallets

## Troubleshooting

### "Access Denied" Error
**Problem**: Can't access admin panel after connecting wallet
**Solution**: 
1. Verify your wallet address is correctly added to `AUTHORIZED_ADMIN_WALLETS`
2. Check for typos in the wallet address
3. Ensure you're connecting with the correct wallet

### "Admin access required" Messages
**Problem**: Admin functions show access errors
**Solution**:
1. Disconnect and reconnect your wallet
2. Refresh the page
3. Verify your wallet is authorized

### Configuration Warning Won't Go Away
**Problem**: Red warning banner still appears
**Solution**:
1. Check that you replaced `YOUR_WALLET_ADDRESS_HERE` with your actual address
2. Ensure the address is in quotes: `'YourActualAddress123...'`
3. Refresh the page

## Example Configuration

Here's what a properly configured admin section looks like:

```javascript
// ADMIN ACCESS CONTROL - Add your wallet address here
const AUTHORIZED_ADMIN_WALLETS = [
    // Replace this with your actual wallet address
    'B1aU7TkJ8yVvQ2sF9dN3mR7eX4pL6hK5nW8zT1qY3oI2',
    // You can add multiple admin wallets if needed
    // 'ANOTHER_ADMIN_WALLET_ADDRESS',
];
```

## Admin Panel URL

Once configured, access your admin panel at:
- Local: `file:///path/to/your/project/admin.html`
- Live: `https://givefi.fun/admin.html`

## Need Help?

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the browser console for error messages
2. Verify your wallet address format
3. Ensure your wallet has some SOL for transaction fees
4. Try disconnecting and reconnecting your wallet
